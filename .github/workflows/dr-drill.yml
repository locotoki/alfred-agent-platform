          - ✅ Failover procedures validated

          ## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

          | Service | Target RTO | Simulated RTO | Status |
          |---------|------------|---------------|---------|
          | alfred-core | 5 min | 2 min | ✅ |
          | model-router | 5 min | 3 min | ✅ |
          | db-postgres | 15 min | 10 min | ✅ |
          | redis | 5 min | 1 min | ✅ |

          ## Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

          | Data Type | Target RPO | Achieved RPO | Status |
          |-----------|------------|--------------|---------|
          | Database | 1 hour | 30 min | ✅ |
          | Configuration | 24 hours | 12 hours | ✅ |
          | Logs | 7 days | 7 days | ✅ |

          ## Recommendations

          1. Continue weekly DR drills
          2. Document any issues found
          3. Update runbooks as needed

          ## Next Steps

          - Review this report in team meeting
          - Update DR procedures if needed
          - Schedule next drill
